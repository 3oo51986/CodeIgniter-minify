# CodeIgniter - minify
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slav123/CodeIgniter-minify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/slav123/CodeIgniter-minify)

## Overview

Simple CodeIgniter library to compress **CSS and JavaScript** files on the fly.

Library is based on few other scripts like <http://code.google.com/p/minify/> 
or <https://code.google.com/p/cssmin> to minify CSS and it uses
[Google Closure compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) to 
compress JavaScript

###INSTALATION:
Just put Minify.php file in libraries path, and create config file on config directory.

###USING THE LIBRARY:

####Configure the library:
All directories needs to be writeable.

	// output path where the compiled files will be stored
    $config['assets_dir'] = 'assets/'; 	
    
    // where to look for css files 
    $config['css_dir'] = 'assets/css';
    
    // where to look for js files 
	$config['js_dir'] = 'assets/js'; 

	// compression engine setting
	$config['compression_engine'] = array(
		'css' => 'minify', // minify || cssmin
    	'js'  => 'closurecompiler' // jsmin || closurecompiler || jsminplus
    );

####Available engines
CSS - *minify* or *cssmin* - both of them are local, just try out which one is better for you,
JS - *closurecompiler* makes API call to external server, it's slower then regular inline engine, but it's super efficient with compression, *jsmin* and *jsminplus* are local

####Run the library
In the controller

    //load the library
	$this->load->library('minify'); 

In view	

	// add css files
	$this->minify->css(array('reset.css', 'style.css', 'tinybox.css')); 
	
	// add js files
	$this->minify->js(array('html5.js', 'main.js')); 
	
	// bool argument for rebuild css (false means skip rebuilding). 
	echo $this->minify->deploy_css(TRUE);

    //Output: '<link href="path-to-compiled-css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />'
    
    // rebuild js (false means skip rebuilding).
    echo $this->minify->deploy_js(); 
 
    //Output: '<script type="text/javascript" src="path-to-compiled-js"></script>'.
